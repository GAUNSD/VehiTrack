#VehiTrack

This was a Ruby on Rails project attempted for HackWestern3. Currently in progress

Concept: Allow users to add "events" to their "Car Profile" that allows them to track relevant information for their car's history.
Example: If someone we're to fix their muffler, they could add the "Muffler Fixed" as an event of type; "Repair" with other relevant information (date, picture, description).
